# Strategy Design Pattern Lab

This project demonstrates two implementations of the Strategy Design Pattern in Java. We use a simple sorting example with Bubble Sort, Quick Sort, and a new sorting method, Merge Sort.

## Structure

- **Approach 1**: The context class (`Sorter`) passes the data to the sorting strategy explicitly.
- **Approach 2**: The strategy holds a reference to the context class (`Sorter`) to access the data.
- **New Sort**: A third sorting method, Merge Sort, is added to both approaches.

## How to Compile and Run

1. Navigate to the `src/Approach1` or `src/Approach2` directories.
2. Compile the Java files using `javac *.java`.
3. Run the main program using `java StrategyPatternExample`.

## Screenshots

Screenshots of the running program can be found in the `screenshots` folder.
